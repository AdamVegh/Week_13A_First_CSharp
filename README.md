# Week_13A_First_CSharp
This is my first C# repo in my life! :)


In this repo you can find three different projects:

- CreateClass: how can you make class; how can we override a method;
how the inheritance works; how can we use interfaces and
how can you clone an object with ICloneable
- TimerEvents: a little task about Tick event handling
- SortString: a little project about useing String.Split, Array.Sort and String.Join
